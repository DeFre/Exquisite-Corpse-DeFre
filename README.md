** This is my Exquisite Corpse. A collaborative story written by any BeCode trainee who wants to take a stab at it. I 'borrowed' this sentence from [The Bottle Imp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bottle_Imp), a short story by Robert Louis Stevenson. Please feel free to add a sentence or three**
